    <h2 style="color: red;">My conversation with a Buddhijibi:</h5>

        <div class="message">
            <p><span class="highlight">Me:</span> I'm in a relationship for the last 3 weeks with a girl. I'm so serious about
                our relationship and give her the maximum effort and priority. But she's minimally serious. She doesn't text or
                call me on her own. I need to text her and she just replies. If I request her to meet, only then she meets. I'm
                feeling hurt inside. What should I do now? It's hard to bear this pain? 😢</p>
        </div>

    <p><span class="buddhijibi">Buddhijibi:</span> It sounds like you're feeling hurt because your efforts and feelings
        are not being reciprocated in the way you hope. Here are some steps you can consider taking:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="important">Communicate Openly:</span> Have a frank and honest conversation with her about how
            you feel. Express your feelings without blaming her, and let her know that you need more engagement from her
            in the relationship. 💬</li>
        <li><span class="important">Evaluate Her Response:</span> Pay attention to her response. If she understands your
            feelings and is willing to make changes, it might be worth giving the relationship more time. If she doesn't
            seem interested in putting in more effort, it might be a sign that she is not as invested in the
            relationship as you are. 🤔</li>
        <li><span class="important">Assess Your Own Needs:</span> Reflect on what you need from a relationship to feel
            happy and fulfilled. If you consistently feel hurt and unimportant, it might be worth reconsidering the
            level of seriousness you are giving to this relationship. 💭</li>
        <li><span class="important">Set Boundaries:</span> Determine what behaviors are acceptable and unacceptable for
            you. Setting clear boundaries can help protect your emotional well-being. 🛑</li>
        <li><span class="important">Consider Taking a Step Back:</span> Sometimes, taking a step back and not
            prioritizing the other person as much can help you see the relationship more clearly. It can also give the
            other person a chance to miss you and possibly realize your value. ⏪</li>
        <li><span class="important">Seek Support:</span> Talk to friends, family, or a counselor about your feelings.
            They can offer support and perspective. 🤗</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="buddhijibi">Buddhijibi:</span> Ultimately, your well-being and happiness are crucial. If the
        relationship continues to make you feel hurt and unfulfilled, it might be worth reconsidering its future. 🌟</p>
</div>

<p><span class="highlight">Me:</span> I did it. I've communicated with her openly and told her how I feel. But nothing
    happened. 😔</p>

<div class="response">
    <p><span class="buddhijibi">Buddhijibi:</span> That's a great first step. How did she respond to your conversation?
        Understanding her reaction can help determine your next steps. If she was receptive and willing to make changes,
        there might be potential for the relationship to improve. If she was indifferent or dismissive, it might be a
        sign to reassess your level of investment in the relationship. 🤷‍♂️</p>
</div>

<p><span class="highlight">Me:</span> She said this is her first relationship and she doesn't know how to be in a
    relationship. She knows nothing about how to manage this kind of relationship. But I don't feel like this is the
    only issue. As I said everything to her, that I'm madly in love with her, her actions may hurt me or make me feel
    good. I feel her emotionally and blah blah. Your response makes me feel neglected... 😟</p>

<div class="response">
    <p><span class="buddhijibi"></span> It's understandable to feel uncertain and even suspicious given her
        response. Here are a few things to consider and steps you might take:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span class="important">Evaluate Her Actions:</span> People often show their true feelings through their
            actions rather than words. If she says she doesn’t know how to be in a relationship but still doesn’t make
            any effort after your conversation, it could be a sign of her level of interest or commitment. 👀</li>
        <li><span class="important">Observe Consistency:</span> Give it some time and see if her behavior changes. If
            she is genuinely interested but inexperienced, she might start putting in more effort after understanding
            your needs. ⌛</li>
        <li><span class="important">Set Clear Expectations:</span> Clarify what you expect in terms of communication and
            engagement. This can help her understand what is needed to make the relationship work. 📋</li>
        <li><span class="important">Balance Your Effort:</span> It's important to balance the effort you put into the
            relationship. If you are always the one initiating contact and making plans, it can create an imbalance that
            might lead to frustration and hurt. ⚖️</li>
        <li><span class="important">Reflect on Your Needs:</span> Consider if the relationship is meeting your emotional
            needs. Being in love is important, but so is feeling valued and respected in the relationship. 💖</li>
        <li><span class="important">Self-Respect and Boundaries:</span> Ensure that you are not compromising your
            self-respect by tolerating neglect or lack of reciprocation. Healthy relationships involve mutual effort and
            respect. 🛡️</li>
        <li><span class="important">Give it Time:</span> Sometimes, people need time to learn and grow into their roles
            in a relationship. Patience can be valuable, but it should not come at the expense of your emotional
            well-being. ⏳</li>
        <li><span class="important">Consider Taking a Break:</span> If you continue to feel hurt and undervalued, it
            might be worth considering a break to gain perspective on the relationship and to see if she steps up when
            she realizes the possibility of losing you. 🚶‍♂️</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="buddhijibi"></span> If the imbalance persists despite your efforts and clear
        communication, it might be worth re-evaluating whether this relationship is the right one for you. Your
        well-being and happiness are paramount, and it's important to be with someone who values and reciprocates your
        feelings. 🌈</p>
